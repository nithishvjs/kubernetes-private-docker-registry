 🚀 Private Docker Registry with Authentication and TLS Setup 🔐🐳

 📚 Overview

Welcome to the Private Docker Registry setup guide! 🎉 This project walks you through setting up a secure private registry using TLS encryption and basic authentication with Docker and Kubernetes. 🔒 The goal is to help you run a secure, self-hosted Docker registry for storing and managing your Docker images in a safe, controlled environment. 🚀
Whether you're managing your own registry for personal or organizational use, this project will guide you through the entire process, from creating SSL certificates to deploying the registry with authentication.

- Kubernetes Cluster 🏗️: A running Kubernetes cluster for deploying and managing your registry.
- Docker 🐳: A containerization platform to build and manage Docker containers.
- kubectl CLI 🎛️: Command-line tool to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
- Azure Access 🌥️: Access to an Azure account for storage configuration and Kubernetes setup.
- Basic Understanding of Kubernetes 📚: Familiarity with Kubernetes deployments, services, and secrets to navigate through the setup process.
